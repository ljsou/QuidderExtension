QuidderExtension
================

Usually, the terms used by users during tagging are different from the terms/queries used when searching for web resources, 
this problem is known as the ["gulf of execution”](http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/1.2/features/chauss/cs.html), which 
describes the cognitive gap between a user’s goals and a system’s functionality or content.

In this sense, although this Chrome extension does not completely solve the above problem, 
it enables the capture of the user's perception about the usefulness of a web resource. To use it, please consider the following.


##Requirements

- Have an internet connection. This extension does not work offline.

So, try again.
